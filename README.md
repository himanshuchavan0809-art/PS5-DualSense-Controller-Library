PS5 DualSense Controller Library providing access to buttons, analog sticks, adaptive triggers, haptic feedback, and motion sensors for custom applications and projects.
This Library enables PS5 controller to pair with your ESP32 module via Bluetooth communication.


**Project Overview**

The PS5 DualSense Controller Library provides an easy and efficient way to interface with the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller in custom projects. This library allows developers to read controller inputs such as buttons, analog sticks, triggers, touchpad, and motion sensors, and integrate them into applications like robotics, gaming, and embedded systems projects.

The library is designed to be simple to use, well-structured, and suitable for both beginners and advanced developers.
